- peeping into H-Scenes of other couples
- use compressed pngs
- use compressed wavs/oggs
- more reeoms? doesnt this work allready?
- Object slots: The game currently loads the 3D Room object assignments from the MP_ITEMS.lst file. It is limited to 4 columns with slots from 7 to 10. It would be great to unlock this limitation to include more columns in this file and assign them slots 11, 12, 13...
(- Basically edit poses either in dialog mode or during sex. You could edit the facial expressions, body pose, etc. and even the displayed message during an interaction with an NPC. Bonus idea: Load dialog poses during sex to take advantage of the existing 3D rooms.)
- Cloth load adhoc: A way to load cloth saves (.cloth files) for any character at any moment of the day. Bonus: change the clothing state (clothed, partially clothed, underwear, etc.) any time during an interaction with an NPC.
- extra socks: I think it would be feasible to add wings to any uniform with this feature, for example. The file jg2p_00_01_00_03.lst in jg2e00_00_00.pp seems to control which leg meshes to load for each type of sock.

- add transformation matrix to hairs. maybe change attachment frame?
- consensual h ai

somewhat done:
h idear:
>If you have ideas for better behavior, shout it out
step 1: pick some foreplay position from the more dom ones.
step 2: pick a foreplay position according to the rapists' sexual preferences.
step 3: pick some rapey position("rapey" is defined by the sex of the rapist)
step 4: pick some position according to the rapist's preference. Include cumming position in the list
step 5: pick some cumming position
repeat steps 3-5 a few times
if rapee has ahegao repeat 3-5 with all positions a few times
maybe add another cumming position and end the scene.

done:
- h ai on no prompt evil
- more than one hairstyle / x-hair for y-hair (full support or override ui?)
- seperate eye texture
- "There's an animation in AEditFacePartsXX.xa that allows for resizing of the mouth width. Would it be possible to add a slider for that? And while we're on the subject, would it be possible to implement more sliders overall, perhaps an extra page of them to allow modders to add more face sliding options to their faces?"
- save eye highlight in card (the entire file)



------------------------
events/actions/expressions:

- handle "minnas"
- h scene ends (to see how many climaxes etc)
- make/prevent ending h scene permaturely (because they were seen / doesnt like the position etc)
- get traits
- set traits
